O: Hey Tim, ... Wake up! 
As you can see, we have you. You were a little annoying piece of shit, but you can prove your worth. 
You have been shrunk, and the only way you can return to your original size is to carry out our orders. 
First you will be sent on a mission to kill some viruses. Do not let us down.

Lvl 2:
O: You have just freed the President from cancer, Hahhh. Now our scientist will grow you to the size of a stink bug, just like you are. You will have to collect this really invasive bug that is ruining our forests. Do your best unless you want to be fed to the spider. The world government believes in you... even though I do not.
Oh, and if you wondering, we have planted a device in your brain so I can always command you!

To be honest, you are showing better results than your fellow inmates. Shrinking the prisoners and getting them to do the dirty work seems to be really effective these days. But don't get too complacent.  You still have work to do, but at this rate, you could be back to your original size by the time Sleepy Joe gets re-elected. 
Those fucking Chinese are trying to destroy the oldest trees on which the American Bold Eagles nest with their trained kamikaze birds. You must protect it!

Lvl 4:
We gave you a chance to redeem yourself, and you try to break into our office? You moron, we will catch you and kill you. You will never get past our security. You cannot defeat the World Government. This project will keep the little bastards like you in your place, we will not have to deal with rebels like you. You'll all just be our slaves! WE WILL GET YOU!

Lvl 5:
Listen, you are making a huge mistake, but luckily you would never find out the secret code. You think you are a great hacker, don't you? Let's see how good your memory and attention to detail are.
